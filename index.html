    <p>
      Peermaps provides a decentralized, cooperative alternative to commercial
      map providers like Google Maps. Instead of fetching data from a
      centralized tile service, fetch map data from your peers using
      <a href="https://webtorrent.io/">webtorrent</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="break"></div>

    <h2><a href="#whyp2p" name="whyp2p">why p2p?</a></h2>

    <p>
      Peer to peer protocols like bittorrent spread out the work of hosting very
      large files among all the peers in the network.
      Centralized services can be overwhelmed if too many people want to
      download a file, but p2p services flip scaling on its head: the more
      people downloading and participating, the better the p2p network works for
      everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the powerful inverse scaling dynamics of p2p, we can run a mapping
      platform at a fixed, small cost, no matter how popular it becomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you use download data from your peers, you keep that data locally so
      that you can share it with other people who ask for it. This means that
      when you go offline, you'll still be able to view maps you've looked at
      previously.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="#how" name="how">how will i use peermaps?</a></h2>

    <p>
      When the technology is ready, you'll be able to embed a map in a web page
      with a `&lt;script&gt;` tag or by using the API directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the underlying p2p tooling, you'll also be able to perform fast
      ad-hoc osm extracts directly over the webtorrent network without
      downloading all of planet osm (30G).
    </p>

    <h2><a href="#plan" name="plan">project plan</a></h2>

    <p>
      Here's the current plan for how the pieces fit together:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Use a <a href="https://github.com/substack/kdb-tree.git">kdb-tree</a>
        to generate a compact spatial index for planet osm protobuf format
        that will also be distributed to bittorrent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extract regions from the spatial index offsets into the planet osm
        protobuf to make tiles with mapnik.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seed tile data to webtorrent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrate peermaps with a leaflet plugin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Offline-ready map editor that can export to Open Street Map and
        localwiki.
      </li>
    </ul>
